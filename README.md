Thank you all! ðŸ’™Personal web site using Flutter.

The main goal was to experience hosting a website on GitHub Pages, along with getting more familiar with exporting a project in Flutter for the web.

Here is the link to the experiment: https://devmhz.github.io/Mohamad_Al-Zoubi/

The mobile layout is weak as the design is not targeted towards mobile as a UI. For a better experience, please use a computer.

Link to the GitHub repository for developers to benefit from:https://github.com/DevMHZ/personal_portfolio_flutterWEB

Feel free to modify the information or add specific features to the project if interested.
